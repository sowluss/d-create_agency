      <h2>Spotlight on Karee Maitland, Digital Project Manager</h2>
      <h4>Monday 4th June 2018</h4>
      <b><p>Official job title?</b>
        <br>
        <br> My official job title is Digital Project/Account Manager.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>What does your role involve?</b>
        <br>
        <br> As project manager my role is to work with our clients to deliver projects on time and within budget. This involves
        booking our internal resources, creating project schedules whilst working closely with our talented designers and
        developers. One of my key tasks is to maintain a close relationship with our clients to ensure they are satisfied
        with the quality of our work.
        <br>
        <br> 
        On completion of each project I monitor the website’s performance using Google Analytics and other digital metrics
        tools to create website analytics and customer insight reports. All this to make sure our clients walk away happy
        with the end result.
        <br>
      <br>
      <b>Which office do you work out of?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I’m based in our London office, in the heart of Hatton Garden.
        <br>
        <b><br>What does a typical day look like for you?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I start a day with a cup of tea (earl grey with unsweetened almond milk... weird I know) and cereal whilst I check
        my emails.
        <br>
        <br> I quickly check action points from the day before and engage our project team to see what the latest status is of
        each component. We discuss the next steps and get cracking. I usually try to find a bit of time during a day to learn
        something new, it could be about one of the Google products, UX etc; all this depends on how busy my day is.
        <br>
        <br> <b>What do you enjoy about your job?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I love the digital world and really enjoy the creation process such as new websites builds. The creative aspect
        of my projects is something I get excited about, working on the designs and technical components of work; which my
        inner-geek finds extremely interesting.
        <br>
        <br> <b>What did you do before joining D-Create?</b>
        <br>
        <br> Before my move to D-Create I used to work in marketing (events, life science, finance, membership bodies) where I was
        running marketing and rebrand campaigns for a variety of different projects.
        <br>
        <br> In my last two jobs, I managed 24 different major website development and transformation projects over 3 years.
        That was when I realised that I’m more into digital project management then marketing so I decided to change the
        direction of my career. I started with new qualifications such as Prince2 and Agile delivery.
        <br>
        <br> <b>What are you passionate about?</b>
        <br>
        <br> In terms of my career I feel very lucky to say that I’m passionate about the digital, technical and creative aspects
        of my job.
        <br>
        <br> Outside of work I’m a gym and yoga addict, and I am very much into healthy living. Spirituality and meditation play
        a huge part in my life. I can never read enough books or watch documentaries about my favourite topics which interest
        me.
        <br>
        <br> <b>What motivates you to succeed?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I love the feeling of being on a mission and I tend to set myself a lot of goals (either personal or professional).
        I’m a self-development addict which can be pretty demanding and my friends make jokes about this often. There is
        nothing better than another completed course, qualification or skill! This is priceless.
        <br>
        <br> <b>Who is your role model and why?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I don’t really have a role model but there are people I admire a lot.
        <br>
        <br> Elon Musk, Richard Branson, David Mackenzie Ogilvy. These
        people have certain common character traits, which I admire a lot: intelligence, ambition, creative brilliance, professional
        discipline, and persistence, believing in your inner strength and never giving up.
        <br>
        <br> <b>Tell us about a project or accomplishment that you consider to be the most significant in your career?</b>
        <br>
        <br> I joined D-Create 2 months ago and I run some really interesting projects; four of which are already live!
        I think I would like to mention DG Sport which was a great team effort and a great outcome. The website contains
        a lot of cool technical solutions, great UX and design and is very dynamic.</p>
